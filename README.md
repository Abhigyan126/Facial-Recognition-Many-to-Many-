# Facial-Recognition-Many-to-Many-
This repository implements a facial recognition system using a combination of MTCNN for face detection, FaceNet for embedding extraction, and SVM for classification.  The code demonstrates how to train a model on a multi-class dataset, saving the trained model for future use. It also includes functionality to recognise faces in real-time videos.
